# Survival-prediction-on-Titanic-dataset-by-Logistic-regression


Logistic regression is a popular algorithm for binary classification problems, and it can be applied to the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features. The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographic data and whether they survived or not. Here's how you can perform logistic regression on the Titanic dataset:

1. Load the Dataset: Load the Titanic dataset, which typically includes features such as passenger class (Pclass), age, gender, number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp), number of parents/children aboard (Parch), fare, and embarked port. The target variable is "Survived," indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

2. Data Preprocessing: Perform data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables if necessary. Missing values can be imputed or removed based on the extent of missingness and the nature of the data. Categorical variables, such as gender or embarked port, can be one-hot encoded to represent them as binary features.

3. Feature Selection: Select relevant features that are likely to have an impact on survival. Consider factors such as age, gender, passenger class, and any other features that may be indicative of survival chances.

4. Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. The training set is used to train the logistic regression model, while the testing set is used to assess its predictive accuracy.

5. Model Training: Fit the logistic regression model using the training data. The model learns the relationship between the selected features and the target variable (Survived) and estimates the coefficients for each feature.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, you can use techniques like cross-validation or ROC curves to assess the model's robustness and determine an optimal threshold for classification.

7. Interpret the Coefficients: Examine the coefficients of the logistic regression model to understand the impact of each feature on the likelihood of survival. Positive coefficients indicate a positive association with survival, while negative coefficients indicate a negative association.

8. Make Predictions: Use the trained logistic regression model to make predictions on the testing dataset or new, unseen data. The model will output probabilities of survival, and you can apply a threshold (e.g., 0.5) to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors.

9. Fine-tuning and Improvement: Depending on the evaluation results, you can fine-tune the logistic regression model by adjusting hyperparameters, feature selection, or incorporating other techniques like regularization (L1 or L2) to improve performance and avoid overfitting.

By applying logistic regression to the Titanic dataset, you can gain insights into the factors that influenced survival and develop a predictive model to classify new passengers based on their characteristics.
